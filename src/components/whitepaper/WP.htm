    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal color:#9FB8FF'>OracleSwap is an oracle tied to
      a specific suite of Ethereum swap contracts. Users create long or short swap
      (aka CFD) positions that reference a unique Oracle contract that warehouses
      prices</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:#222222'>.</span><a name="_ftnref1"></a><a href="#_ftn1"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref1'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[1]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref1'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref1'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>

        Initial contracts reference ETH/USD,
        BTC/USD, and the US stock market (S&amp;P500). An emphasis on simplicity
        reduces risk and makes the contract as straightforward as a vending machine,
        one-click to take liquidity with all ETH secure in a verified contract, with no
        emails or off-balance sheet processing: your margin is only accessible via your private key and the weekly settlement. Everything is open source, so users can
        audit the contracts and download blockchain front-end onto their personal computer to enhance
        privacy and security.</p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>Secure property rights imply
          free entry by firms and free choice among consumers, creating competition, the
          ultimate form of decentralization. Ethereum is like Tor in that it cannot be
          censored, facilitating entry and choice, but adds a secure payment system and
          vendor accountability via its immutable and transparent blockchain</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";color:#222222'>.</span><a name="_ftnref2"></a><a href="#_ftn2"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref2'><span
                class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;
    color:#9FB8FF'>[2]</span></span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref2'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref2'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> OracleSwap is both a functional contract to use, and also a template for emulators. Ideally, there will be many liquidity providers on the initial OracleSwap contracts competing on fees, but also imitators, as copying this contract and administering its oracle requires the modest resources of your typical college student. A market of such dapps would make an outsider's attempt to censor a particular oracle as pointless as removing a PC from a peer-to-peer network.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Fewer agents and processes simplify the game,
      making it easier to align incentives and reduce costs. The only users are <i>liquidity providers,</i>
      <i>investors,</i> and the <i>oracle.</i> There are no tokens, wrappers, validators, settlers,
      relayers, etc. We use a novel set of methods to minimize transaction costs and align incentives
      to solve the oracle problem. Its radical shift is to have a pseudonymous oracle tied
      to a specific contract in a repeated game with a form of mutually assured destruction:
      it is straightforward to parameterize the contract so that the cost/benefit ratio for
      cheating is 50/1.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Liquidity Providers (LPs) are
      paid via closing fees and funding rates they set. LPs post ETH as margin,
      allowing investors to take long or short positions that start at the next
      business-day closing price, and their required margin covers their maximum
      liability</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:#222222'>.</span><a name="_ftnref3"></a><a href="#_ftn3"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[3]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref3'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> Fills are based on forward-starting prices, which
        eliminates price-impact and front-running, simplifies oracle monitoring, and
        eliminates the need for low-latency access. An LP's margin requirement is
        netted and settlement is batched and scalable to thousands of investors,
        creating attractive LP returns at attractive rates for investors. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>OracleSwap targets long-term investors wanting to take
      a position over the next several months. As many
      are waiting for low-latency layer 2 solutions, it is important to understand
      that low latency provides nothing of value to a long term investor:
      forward-starting VWAP-style trade execution is considered best practice
      for anyone but short-term speculators. We also provide Managed Account
      contracts that allow ETH whales to delegate their ETH to managers who
      can attend to LP duties while providing the safety of a traditional managed
      account: the manager can only execute transactions with Oracle Swap,
      and cannot send ETH to outside accounts or contracts. This provides a
      way for large ETH holders to securely allow others to administer their
      LP duties. As in everything in this contract, the only risk is via a
      fraudulent oracle price. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A counterparty who does not
      cancel merely needs to have sufficient margin to maintain their position.
      Margins are debited/credited weekly, and a position's required margin caps the
      PNL so that investors need only attend to their positions once a week to avoid
      default. If one's counterparty cancels, they can costlessly put on a
      replacement position as only the initiator of a cancel pays the cancel fee. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The Coase Theorem highlights how
      low transaction costs and secure property rights are the foundation of efficient
      economic outcomes</span>.<a name="_ftnref4"></a><a href="#_ftn4"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>[4]</span></span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'></span></a><span
        style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref4'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> Novel
        blockchain properties like anonymity and immutability have created unfamiliar
        transaction costs that have stifled contract development. As the blockchain
        creates the strongest property rights in human history, these problems should
        be temporary. Financial derivatives are perfect candidates for smart contracts
        because they apply simple rules to prices determined elsewhere. Conditional
        upon accurate prices, it is straightforward to create a ledger within a
        Solidity contract that is fair and secure. </p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>One key is <i>not</i> to emulate
      a modern stock market. The standard is now the centralized limit order book,
      where users costlessly post, take and cancel limit orders. These markets are
      run on centralized databases and allow direct market access at under ten
      milliseconds. In contrast, interacting with an Ethereum contract is at least
      1000 times slower and more costly, creating a classic example of Akerlof's
      market for lemons</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";
color:#222222'>.</span><a name="_ftnref5"></a><a href="#_ftn5"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[5]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref5'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> Compared to centralized exchanges, blockchain latency
        forces market makers to post bid-ask spreads so wide they cannot attract the
        casual traders needed to work well.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A standard central limit order
      book has three types of traders: noise, informed, and market makers. <i>Noise </i>traders
      do not affect the price because their order flow is random, which implies their
      trades are small (large trades require multiple autocorrelated transactions). <i>Market
        makers </i>provide instant liquidity by posting two-sided resting limit orders
      where their bid is below their ask price. <i>Informed </i>traders have an
      information advantage that predicts future order flow, which can come from
      inside information or something as straightforward as knowing they have many
      more orders to fill on the same side. In equilibrium, the market maker needs to
      make enough revenue off the noise traders to cover the losses generated from
      informed traders. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Higher latency subjects limit
      orders to greater adverse selection, where the resting limit orders supplied by
      market makers that tend to get filled are the bids that are too high or the
      offers that are too low. Greater adverse selection causes the market makers to
      post wide spreads compared to low latency markets, making the centralized
      exchanges the dominant choice for noise traders. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The higher latency exchanges are
      left with a higher proportion of informed traders, which in turn causes the
      market makers to increase their bid-ask spreads further to compensate for the
      greater adverse selection. These higher spreads disproportionately discourage
      the day (noise) traders, as they have short horizons disproportionately
      impacted by the spread. This positive-feedback loop causes markets to
      ultimately unravel, as the noise traders essential for limit order books
      disappear<span class=MsoHyperlink><span style='color:#9FB8FF;text-decoration:
none;text-underline:none'>. </span></span>There is no chicken-and-egg problem
      facing current blockchain-based limit order books; high spreads and low volumes
      are intrinsic to any high-latency alternative market.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>For long-term crypto investors, the
      low-latency exchanges off the Ethereum blockchain come at a price. The lightly
      regulated exchanges have considerable operational risk, and legal recourse in
      the event of a dispute is improbable, making them imprudent for large sums. The
      highly regulated exchanges have low credit risk and are essential for
      converting between fiat and crypto, but they then put users back on the
      traditional financial grid, removing anonymity, and have pathetic leverage and
      shorting capabilities per regulatory dictates. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>OracleSwap eliminates the limit
      order book by using forward-starting, oracle-supplied prices to avoid latency
      effects while staying on the blockchain. For assets with liquid cash markets,
      price discovery is a problem already solved. This solution is inspired by
      value-weighted-average-price (VWAP) transactions, a popular equity trading
      tactic among long-term institutional investors. The time lag in trade execution
      does not inconvenience long-term investors, and their fill efficiency can be
      assessed quickly and easily. OracleSwap uses market-on-close orders, which are
      conceptually similar to VWAP but more straightforward and efficient given the
      liquid assets we are initially targeting</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:
"Times New Roman";color:#222222'>.</span><a name="_ftnref6"></a><a href="#_ftn6"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref6'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[6]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref6'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref6'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Most VWAP trading is done on a
      best-effort basis, where the VWAP broker merely targets the 'average price' and
      charges a fee (around 0.1 cents per share). This relationship puts the VWAP
      brokers in the same position as our oracle: the main reason they do not charge
      a dishonest price and make 30 times their fee in one day is the loss of future

    <p class=MsoNormal>By avoiding the adverse
      selection risk in limit order books, LPs neither endure this unnecessary
      expense, nor do they need to invest time and money minimizing it. The absence
      of limit order books also allows investors to avoid parceling out an order to
      prevent moving market bid-ask prices, so completing a trade at a fair price
      takes the same amount of time whatever the size. Lower indirect costs combined
      with portfolio margining make it easier for LPs to generate an attractive
      return at competitive rates for long-term investors. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The common idea articulated by
      Antonopolous and Wood is a major reason why Ethereum dapp development has been
      slow. Decentralization is a good thing, but like democracy, not at every level.
      A decentralized blockchain with contracting capability can give centrally administered
      dapps the essential benefits of decentralization without the considerable
      costs. A pseudonymous oracle embedded within a decentralized blockchain gives
      it protection from outside attacks and censorship. The other decentralization
      benefits, such as fault tolerance and conspiracy resistance, are easier to
      achieve via a centralized oracle</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:

    <p class=MsoNormal>The benefit of market
      decentralization is that by giving individuals property rights, those with the
      most relevant information have the incentive to allocate resources towards
      their highest-valued use, the classic invisible hand of Adam Smith. While
      decentralization is necessary for a prosperous economy, this does not imply
      firms within such an economy must be decentralized, and very few are. In the
      same way, while a blockchain must be decentralized to preserve essential crypto
      principles, this does not imply oracles must be as well. The idea that oracles
      must be decentralized is a <i>category error</i>, assuming the part must
      independently have the properties of the whole.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Blockchain decentralization is
      essential at its highest level to protect against outsiders or insiders who
      would steal funds or peremptorily change the protocol, as a hard fork would
      simply replace the attacked one. In this way, even though there are only a
      handful of Ethereum mining pools, they are still fundamentally decentralized.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Conditional upon a blockchain's
      core users demanding adherence to foundational bitcoin principles, it is
      trustless only in the sense that mining pools have the ability but not the will
      to implement a 51% attack. Anyone with the power to do so would be ruining a
      costly investment for modest double-spend. We trust miners to act in their
      self-interest. Our oracle is trustless in the same way.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Time-consuming mechanisms that
      make it seemingly impossible for agents to collude are not just inefficient,
      but nave. All functional dapps that profess an ultimate aim of having a
      decentralized oracle parenthetically admit they have a centralized one
      for the time being, and then emphasize the magic of decentralization. A
      better objective is to make cheating possible but unattractive.
      Things that work on the blockchain&#8212;MakerDAO's oracle, bitcoin mining pools,
      Infura&#8212;all <i>can</i> collude maliciously, but their self-interest prevents
      this. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A single agent with sole
      non-transferable oracle rights and responsibilities has a stronger incentive to
      be honest than a fluid set of agents reporting on a wide variety of events that
      no one can easily monitor. Given permissionless access to the blockchain, a
      consensus mechanism is both unnecessary and inefficient; there is no reason to
      think that the key to creating an honest, accurate oracle is that they contain
      legions. Decentralization is only necessary at a higher level; below that it is
      strictly unhelpful. </p>

        minimize contextual transaction costs. These costs consist of search and
        information costs, bargaining costs, and policing and enforcement costs. The
        blockchain consensus has the unique ability to verify block integrity on chain, which makes
        it a poor template for oracles where this is impossible.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The game-theoretic field of <i>mechanism
        design</i> highlights two necessary conditions for a good dapp. First, there is
      a <i>participation</i> constraint that motivates players to want to participate
      in the oracle's game. A platform may incent honest reporting, but the
      costs&#8212;not the explicit fees so much as the delay, complexity, and bid-ask
      spread&#8212;make 'not playing' the preferred choice. Secondly, there is an <i>incentive
        compatibility</i> constraint that the oracle achieves its best outcome by reporting
      truthfully. Incentive compatibility is key to low-cost enforcement of
      contracts, and historically this mechanism centered on reputation, not contract
      law administered by the state.</span><a name="_ftnref9"></a><a href="#_ftn9"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref9'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[9]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref9'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref9'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> When agents have incentives aligned with their
        counterparties, we minimize policing and enforcement costs, which makes it
        easier to satisfy the participation constraint.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Decentralized oracles create
      several costs that have proved impossible to overcome. For example, a subset
      within a decentralized oracle can reap 100% of the cheating benefits while
      bearing less than 100% of the costs, meaning any minimum payment needed to keep
      the oracle actor honest must be inflated. Sybil attacks are only solved by
      implementing KYC or a whitelist, which removes anonymity and censorship
      resistance. The diverse set of use cases imply that the oracle's incentives
      will not be optimized for any specific contract they are servicing. Consensus
      mechanisms add parties and processes that increase cost, complexity, and delay.
    </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Simplicity
        is essential for robust contracts because analyzing a game becomes
        exponentially complicated as the number of actions and participants increases.

        either cheat, play honestly, or free ride on whatever everyone else is doing, 3</span><i><sup><span style='font-size:14.0pt;color:#9FB8FF'>n</span></sup></i><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> scenarios arise. OracleSwap's oracle is the only

        reporting is maximized; by being unambiguously responsible and easy to audit
        and punish, its costs from misreporting are fully born by the oracle; by
        playing a specific repeated game the cost/benefit calculus is consistent each

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>A subcontract is a bilateral
      agreement between a Liquidity Provider (<b>LP</b>) and Investor for a
      particular asset (e.g., SPX). It has a constant <i>Required Margin </i>(<b>RM</b>),
      which is implies a notional amount via the <i>Leverage Ratio </i>and the
      ETH price.<a name="_ftnref13"></a><a href="#_ftn13"><span style='mso-bookmark:
_ftnref13'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[13]</span></span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref13'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref13'></span>
    </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Unlike many crypto exchanges
      where investors choose notional amounts and then their leverage (e.g., 2x, 5x),
      which determines their margin, in OracleSwap the required margin defines the
      position. This then implies an ETH notional amount, which then implies a USD
      notional amount via a changing ETH price. The leverage ratio is set so that the
      RM covers a 3-standard deviation PNL in the notional, indicating one should
      expect the next settlement to create a debit or credit of one-third of their
      RM. The initial investor margin of 1.5RM is a simple way to make sure investors are
      prepared, as OracleSwap is designed for long-term investors, an investor should
      be prepared for a couple of adverse settlements.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Those desiring lower leverage
      can overfund their margin without changing their position exposure, as the RM
      determines the notional exposure, not the total ETH in an investor or LP's
      margin. The player's risk is also not affected by their actual/total margin
      ETH, as the RM caps their maximum liability, via market risk
      or fraud (the fraud attack would be via prices to PNL, which is
      capped at the RM).</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The weekly cash flow, the PNL
      (for <b>P</b>rofit a<b>N</b>d <b>L</b>oss), is the amount debited from one
      counterparty and credited to the other. For example, in going long BTC,
      implicitly, the trade is as follows: at open buy USD with ETH and then buy BTC
      with USD, at close sell BTC for USD and then sell USD for ETH. This sequence is
      like when a US investor invests in a Japanese stock: she needs first to buy yen
      to buy the stock, and eventually sell the stock for yen, which she sells for
      USD. The contract does not do each of those transactions, but it prices them
      all to generate the weekly PNL, which perforce is in ETH. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>This USD adjustment is made
      because users care mainly in the USD returns of their investments. If there
      were no adjustments for the USD price of ETH, as in the BitMEX BTCETH perpetual
      swap, to prevent arbitrage one must account for the ETH correlation with the
      asset and put this term into the funding rate. Given the high correlation
      between the ETH and BTC, as well as between the ETH and itself, this term is
      generally larger than any reasonable asset expected return (i.e., &gt; 50%
      annualized). While short term traders may not mind (over 8 hours it is
      seemingly insignificant), this is an intolerable risk for long term investors
      merely interested in an asset's USD return. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>As each subcontract implies
      symmetric PNLs to its counterparties, investor and LP, we need only calculate
      the PNL for one party: <i>PNL<sup>investor</sup>= &#8210; PNL<sup>LP</sup></i>.
      At settlement every counterparty within an LP's book is credited or debited per
      their PNL, which does not change the book's total balance via the equality. </p>

        The Effect of the PNL Collar</span><span style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman"'></span></h2>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>PNL is capped at the RM so each player
      is assured their counterparty can cover any potential liability. The PNL caps
      make a long position like a long in the underlying plus a portfolio containing
      a long put/short call that creates a <i>collar position</i>. The value of this
      option portfolio is dependent on whether the cost of the call minus the put is
      significantly different from zero. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Unlike most collars, this one
      has extreme out-of-the-money options. Leverage ratios (LRs) are set so that the
      margin covers 99.5% of weekly outcomes. Simulating contract PNL
      using actual data since 2016, only 4 out of 573 weeks generated a PNL capped by
      the RM, 0.6% of the observations. The outliers were for the ETH contract: twice
      in early 2017 when ETH doubled in value, and at the beginning of 2018 when ETH
      fell by one-third. While the SPX margin in this period seems, if anything, overly
      conservative, this period was one of below-average volatility. Using weekly
      data back to 1986, and with assumptions about ETH volatility, a 10% margin
      (i.e., 10x leverage) generated an insignificant number of violations.
    </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>To better estimate the effects
      of the RM cap, we ran simulations assuming 100% annualized crypto volatility
      and correlations of 0.9. These generated economically irrelevant net effects,
      in that the annualized value is less than 0.4% annualized. To the degree
      participants wish to value the PNL caps and put this into the negotiation
      between long and short, it belongs in the basis. Funding rates on most
      exchanges are orders of magnitude higher than 0.4% annually, implying the value
      of the PNL cap is economically irrelevant relative to other issues influencing
      supply and demand for long and short positions.</p>

        Providers in most markets are paid via the bid-ask spread.
        OracleSwap has no trading at maker-supplied prices, so our makers, the LPs,

        rates their long and short investors pay and can change them at any time;

    <p class=MsoNormal>A swap referencing a cash price
      must adjust for the <i>basis</i> one sees in futures/forward market curves. The
      basis accounts for the opportunity cost of money (e.g., interest rates), and
      the costs and benefits of owning the asset outside of its price appreciation
      (e.g., storage costs, dividends). If there were no basis, one could invest cash
      in money markets, go long a futures position, and make the same return as
      investing in the asset plus the interest rate earned in money markets, which is
      not an equilibrium.<a name="_ftnref14"></a><a href="#_ftn14"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref14'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[14]</span></span></span><span

      A basis is charged symmetrically, subtracting from the long return and adding
      to the short. The LP will implicitly set a basis when setting different funding
      rates for long and short takers to equilibrate their exposure.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>While it is useful for investors to
      understand the effects of interest rates and other factors on the basis,
      ultimately, this differential is determined by supply and demand. OracleSwap's
      funding rates are capped in absolute value at 1% per week for ETH and BTC, and
      0.25% for SPX (1-week return standard deviations are about 10% and 3%,
      respectively)</p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>LPs settle their books in the
      period 24 to 48 hours after the Friday oracle price update. This delay
      gives everyone 24 hours to cure their margins and avoid default if they have
      not already canceled. The LP settlement takes one
      function for books with less than 200 subcontracts, but above a certain point a
      book must be settled in parts. This allows for efficient scalability. An LP should read the
      Technical Appendix for more detail.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>For an investor, only a
        negative PNL can create a situation where a player's currently adequate margin
        will be deficient if not cured at settlement, but a negative PNL does not
        necessarily imply an inadequate subsequent margin. For example, if an
        investor's RM=10 and they have 11 in their margin, an impending PNL indicating
        a loss of 2 ETH implies they need to add at least 1 ETH to their margin at settlement
        to avoid default. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>For an LP margin adequacy
        is more nuanced, in that they could have a situation where a cancel increases
        their net RM, implying a margin cure is needed even if the LP's net PNL was 0.
        For example, if long and short 10 ETH (<i>aka</i> flat), and the long canceled or defaulted,
        their RM will rise from zero to 10 ETH. They must monitor their book to anticipate
        cancellations and defaults at the impending weekend settlement. LP economics
        are best for someone who is complimenting a natural long position, so an LP
        should have considerable excess margin available, whether in their margin
        or off the contract. </p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>At weekly settlement, if the PNL
      takes a player's margin below their RM, they are in default, and the
      subcontract is terminated immediately. A default does not cost the
      non-defaulting counterparty anything, as this just means the defaulter was
      unprepared for the next week, not that it did not have enough to pay their
      debit that week. Defaults are only due to negligence, as by Friday morning one
      has a good estimate of their impending PNL and the ability to cancel if they
      suspect they cannot cure their margin by settlement; after Friday 4 PM, players
      will know their PNL with certainty and have at least 24 hours to cure their
      margin. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>An LP that fails to run their book's
      settlement function within 48 hours after the oracle settlement update can be put
      into default. The first investor to run the 'inactiveLP' function gets the LP's
      default fee, and all investors can then redeem their subcontracts and withdraw
      their ETH. If an LP defaults by not having enough margin to cover her required
      margin, all her subcontracts are canceled at that settlement, and the book cannot
      accept new investors.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>If a player has less than &frac12;&#8729;RM
      in their margin at default (e.g., they have 1.4 ETH in the margin of a subcontract
        with an RM=1.0
      ETH, and lose 1.0 ETH), the default payment is the maximum of &frac12;&#8729;RM and whatever
      is there. The fact the oracle gets the default fee should motivate the LP to
      burn instead of default in the case where the LP thinks they were cheated via
      fraudulent prices. A burn would prevent an evil oracle from receiving both the
      LP's PNL debit <i>and</i> the default fee. </p>

      of LP size. However, processing 250 investors in one LP uses less gas than if
      there were 10 investors across 25 LPs since each LP settles their own book
      independently. Further, the more investors one has, the greater the likelihood
      the individual book will be flat due to the law of large numbers, and the greater
      the ratio of total notional exposure to net exposure. This incents those who
      are LPs to become larger than average, which brings down costs, and via
      competition will ultimately lead to lower funding rates and closing fees. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk13494273"><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>LPs are
          protected from getting too one-sided via a restriction on new positions, in

        investors to always bring a book back towards being 'flat' (i.e., Long=Short)
        but prevents increases in net position from using up the LP's available RM.
        Thus, an initial allocation of 100 ETH may incent only long positions, but they
        are stopped out at 50 ETH.</p>


      <p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk13494273"><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Lastly, there

      which can only send its money back to the address that created its position.
      The investor has sole ability to withdraw funds from the contract. Many brokerage
       accounts have this capability, where the manager can buy and sell stocks on
       an exchange, but they cannot withdraw cash. It has a built-in mechanism to

    <p class=MsoNormal>When an investor takes a
      position, the counterparties are committed to a swap from the next business day
      close to the subsequent settlement. The initial margin is set 50% higher than
      the maintenance margin because investors should realize there is a 50% chance
      they will lose money at the first settlement. As a PNL standard deviation is
      about one-third of the RM, investors should have some excess margin available
      if they expect to invest for multiple weeks, and the initial requirement
      reminds them of this.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>In the event of an LP closing
      the subcontract, that investor can replace the position at no cost because only
      the initiator of a close pays the close fee, and there is no open fee. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A subcontract uses the
      subsequent oracle-reported closing prices as its starting price. These are
      taken on New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) business days at 4 PM.<a name="_ftnref17"></a><a href="#_ftn17"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref17'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;

      3 PM will have its initial fill price taken on Monday close; a contract taken
      Monday at 6 PM will have its first price use the Tuesday close. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Investors cannot take during the
      4:00 to 5:00 PM hour. This restriction prevents gaming the latency between the
      4 PM prices and when those prices are reported to the oracle. Takes also cannot
      occur in the settlement period, between the Friday oracle price update and the LP
      settlement that occurs between 24 and 48 hours after the Friday oracle
      settlement update. This makes it easier for LPs to determine their net required
      margin when settlement is executed. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>For any subcontract (aka
      position), after the first week, all subsequent PNL-relevant pricings use
      Friday closings. Investors and LPs can fund their margins at any time. They can
      withdraw Excess Margin at any time except the Settlement Period, encouraging players
      to burn a debit PNL rather than subject themselves to another settlement with
      an evil oracle, which encourages oracle honesty.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>A standard cancel before the
      Friday oracle contract update terminates the subcontract at the subsequent
      settlement. After book settlement, the investor of a canceled contract must
      redeem their position to move their entire margin from the LP's book contract
      to the AssetSwap contract, where they can then withdraw it to their personal
      address. This two-step process protects user funds, and also saves on gas in
      the weekly book settlement. Investors can cancel using intraweek prices (e.g.,
      Monday), though the LP must have sufficient excess margin. Canceling intraweek
      still requires waiting until the weekly settlement to retrieve their funds, and
      they pays the maximum LP closing fee.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Investors cannot cancel in their
      first week. This is because new subcontracts are processed differently in the
      settlement, and also because we want to encourage long-term investors. LP's can
      unilaterally cancel all their subcontracts and close their book with a
      28-day notice, allowing all takers to exit at the first settlement after
      this date is toggled at no cost. This feature is available because canceling
      hundreds of positions individually would be daunting, and 4 weeks is sufficient
      time for investors to find new LPs.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>ETH left in a player's margin or
      the AssetSwap contract is there permanently until the user withdraws it, as
      there is no self-destruct or other mechanism that can freeze accounts.
      Withdrawal of excess margin, like redemptions, take two steps: one withdraws
      ETH to the AssetSwap contract, then from the AssetSwap contract to the ETH
      account addressed used to fund the initial position. </p>

            the prior week) is its only ability to affect player margins, via prices affecting
            the PNL applied at settlement. When a trade is made the AssetSwap contract pulls
             the current day in the Oracle contract to determine its start or end pricing day,
             and so this simple array of prices is sufficient to administer the OracleSwap 
             contracts. The contract return is calculated on the oracle contract using the
              relevant prices and leverage ratios, and at settlement is pushed to the AssetSwap
              contracts. This vector of returns is then used in the weekly settlement. OracleSwap's
               oracle will usually update the oracle around 4:15 PM, but network traffic and
               occasional testing of its backup servers may generate some variability.  </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>We target a couple-minute window slightly after
        4 PM for sampling market prices, as this is the close of US equity markets,
        a good benchmark for the 'end of day.' The data are pulled&#8212;directly and
        indirectly&#8212;from several Bitwise-approved exchanges in a couple-minute

        auditing the oracle should be aware that historical crypto databases use
        different intraday closing times. The Winkdex index records 4 PM prices for ETH
        and BTC and so, currently at least, provides a useful reference for ETH and BTC
        prices. The median price from several exchanges, sampled at intervals that can vary
        up to 5 minutes, generates a standard error relative to a 'true' price. This
        variability would be fatal for a real-time system, but for long term investors,
        where neither side to a transaction has a latency advantage, such imprecision
        is both unbiased and immaterial for long-term investors.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>In a worst-case scenario where the oracle does not
      update prices&#8212;which would
      prevent settlement&#8212;all players can withdraw their entire margin if the
      contract has not been settled for ten days. An inactive oracle would also
      prevent anyone from using the contracts, in that settlements could never
      happen, and users could withdraw any money accidentally sent to the contract..</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The negligible processing and data storage requirements
    imply an oracle with a very light footprint. The oracle's main job is to
    automate scripts that pull data, and as these are not real-time prices, one
    does not have to pay for low-latency data feeds, but rather can use stale
    data (5 to 15 minutes old) that is uncensorable. Data problems are mitigated
    by using a variety of sources, targeting different minute windows, and computers
    in different geographic regions, but the total cost is trivial in that you can
     buy server space for only $10 a month, and the software needed to run data
     scraping programs are open source. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A fraudulent price should elicit
      a burn, and as burns are costly, they show someone cared enough to pay to punish
      the oracle. A truly fraudulent price report by
      the oracle should discourage any future players, but as such allegations are
      uncensorable, further investigation is recommended as the burner could be
      mistaken or mischievous. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Open fee</span></b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>: 0%. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>There is no open fee. Further,
      there is no bid-ask spread. It is useful to remember this because even though
      some exchanges charge only a close fee, there is always the cost of the bid-ask
      spread, and if one has a large position, trade impact. These non-explicit costs
      are present on both sides of a trade on almost every exchange other than
      OracleSwap. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Close fee</span></b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>: 1.0-2.0% notional for crypto, 0.25-0.50% for SPX.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The close fee is set at trade
      instantiation based on the closing fee listed at the time of trade in the LP's
      book. The close fee consists of a fixed oracle fee and a variable LP fee. The
      oracle fee is 1.0% of notional for ETH and BTC positions, and 0.25% for SPX
      positions. The LP can set their closing fee anywhere from 0% to 1.00% for
      cryptos, 0% to 0.25% for the SPX, which is then added to the oracle's fee to
      generate a total closing fee. An investor canceling their position pays this
      directly when executing a cancel, not through a deduction of their margin.
    </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>If the LP cancels, they pay 2
      times the base oracle rate, which then goes entirely to the oracle. For
      intraweek cancels, those that apply a closing price before the settlement
      day, investors pay the LP maximum closing rate regardless of their subcontract's
      initial closing fee. This premium is to compensate the LP for the impact on
      her Required Margin. LPs cannot cancel intraweek. Thus LP cancels, and intraweek
      investor cancels, pay a total close fee of 2.0% for crypto, 0.5% for SPX.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Funding Rate</span></b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>: -1% to 1% weekly for crypto, -0.25% to 0.25% weekly for
        SPX.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>These are purely market-driven
      rates, as LPs set these rates to balance their books and compete for investors.
      Competition and scale should reduce their average size over time.
      This rate is a composite of a rate for the LP's service and a basis rate that
      equilibrates supply and demand. As the basis is a symmetric charge from long to
      short, the funding rate could be negative (implying, a credit for the
      investor). Any subcontract has a fixed funding rate for its duration. It is
      transferred to the LP via the PNL calculation at weekly settlement.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Default fee: </span></b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>&frac12;&#8729;RM.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>If a player defaults, they are
      charged 50% of their RM. Players can never
      withdraw margin below their RM, so a default can only occur at the weekly
      settlement. The default fee is sent to the oracle to make users more inclined
      to burn rather than default, in that a cheating oracle would get the fraudulent
      PNL and the default fee if not burned. As players have 24 hours to cure their
      margin and should cancel before the Friday oracle update if they foresee an
      inability to cure their margin, any default would be due to gross negligence. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>Burn fee</span></b><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>: &frac12;&#8729;RM.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>This fee should never be invoked
      because the oracle is incented to be honest, and a dishonest oracle price is
      the only rational reason for an investor to burn. However, a player who thinks
      the oracle is cheating can pay a fee of 50% of
      his RM to preclude his counterparty&#8212;presumably an agent of the oracle&#8212;from
      receiving its PNL debit via fraudulent pricing. This fee is applied via a
      payable function and is <b>effectively burned</b> to remove strategic
      implications from some party that might game this system (the burn amount is
      not credited to any user's margin, inaccessible). After the settlement at which
      the burn is applied, the player margin is fully redeemable (i.e., instead of
      being debited &frac12;&#8729;RM upon redemption in default, the user pays &frac12;&#8729;RM but then is
      not debited at redemption).</span><a name="_ftnref20"></a><a href="#_ftn20"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref20'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[20]</span></span></span><span

    <p class=MsoNormal>OracleSwap consists of three Ethereum contracts: An Oracle,
    AssetSwap, and Book contract. There are no libraries. The oracle contract (200
      lines) warehouses the relevant price data and calculates the contract returns
       at settlement, pushing the returns to the three AssetSwap contracts (ETH,
         SPX and BTC). The AssetSwap contracts are identical, with about 400 lines
         of code. They differ only in the prices and leverage used to generate the
         returns. LPs then have separate Book contracts created from each AssetSwap
         contract, that interact only through their specific AssetSwap contracts.
         These book contracts are identical, and contain about 400 lines of code.
         Security issues and code logic are addressed in the Technical Appendix.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>We also provide the front-end
      code used to access the Ethereum contracts on Github, so users can download
      this to their PCs for both privacy, auditing, and as a basis for developing
      their own OracleSwap-like contracts. There is also a python file that one can
      use to update their own oracles, though we do not provide APIs or web-scrapers,
      as we do not want anyone to know precisely how these work to prevent
      countermeasures by data providers. There are many ways to pull data for free when
      you do not need real-time data. </p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>The managed account solidity files are templates that
      can be customized as one wishes. This can facilitate use by giving large
      ETH holders a mechanism for delegating a manager without worrying that the
      manager would abscond with their funds. </p>

color:#CCDAFF'>Oracle's Incentives</span></h1>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>The oracle owns a
      non-transferable annuity of closing fees from OracleSwap contracts, and
      comparing the value of this annuity to a potential cheat payoff shows the
      oracle's dominant strategy is to be honest. Reducing the oracle to a single
      agent makes this easier because this maximizes the percentage of fees going to
      the oracle agent and makes accountability unambiguous. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Each AssetSwap contract is
      hardcoded to the oracle contract, so this is the sole source of prices used in
      generating subcontract payoffs throughout its life. The only attack vector
      involves the oracle posting fraudulent prices, where an evil oracle is
      conspiring with one of the counterparties, say by reporting an actual -3%
      return as a +7% return, effectively stealing 10%. Presumably, a cunning evil
      oracle would remove the middleman and be that counterparty using a different
      account it controlled; an evil oracle in practice is an evil oracle/counterparty
      sock-puppet. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The key to an honest oracle is
      that it plays a repeated game where players can quickly and meaningfully react
      to dishonest play.<a name="_ftnref21"></a><a href="#_ftn21"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[21]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref21'></span>
      The oracle's incentive structure is like that in the iterated prisoner's
      dilemma, where a multi-period game moves the dominant strategy from the
      suboptimal equilibrium where both parties maximize their one-period payoff by
      not cooperating, to the optimal equilibrium where parties maximize their
      payoffs by cooperating<a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>.</span></a> In evolutionary biology, this shows up in <i>reciprocal
        altruism</i> and illustrates how cooperation emerges out of long-run

    <p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Hlk16083194"><span style='color:#9FB8FF'>If the

          than &frac12;&#8729;RM in their margins
          would find default cheaper than burning, though, whatever is in their margin
          for the default fee, in addition to the fraudulent PNL, would go to the oracle,
          which should motivate players to burn out of righteous spite.</span></a></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>As it is prudent to overfund
      one's margin to save on gas and given the prevalence of overfunding margins by
      300% on MakerDAO, we should expect most players to have an overfunded margin.
      If users generally expose themselves to more risk in this way, it actually
      lowers their risk collectively, in that it signals to the oracle that if he
      goes rogue, he should expect all those accounts to burn, which then eliminates
      the cheat payoff. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>As all investors transact with
      an LP, this makes the burn attribution nontrivial but straightforward. Burns
      are allocated pro-rata against the other side: if burning parties represent 80% of the afflicted side, then each player on
      their counterparty side party gets only 20% of their calculated PNL credited to
      their margins.</span><a name="_ftnref23"></a><a href="#_ftn23"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref23'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;color:#9FB8FF'>[23]</span></span></span><span
          style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref23'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref23'></span><span style='color:#9FB8FF'> </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The burn fee must be high to
      avoid griefing, and so the choice should require enough pain to prevent
      frivolous burns harming innocent players. A burn generates an event log
      highlighting the date of the fraudulent prices and should make it easy for
      outsiders to assess, though a conscious choice to burn is costly and pointless
      given an honest oracle. As it would be irrational for one to transact with an
      oracle who has ever cheated, a true cheat should destroy future oracle revenue.
      This is unlike many other oracles, where a cheater is presumed a rogue anomaly,
      'punished' by having to create a new identity within the same oracle umbrella.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>To generate a scheming oracle's
      cost-benefit analysis, we compare the potential benefits of an exit scam with
      the costs. The lost revenue comes from the expected closing fees of the
      subcontracts. 1.0% of crypto notional and 0.25% of SPX notional translates to
      2.5% of the RM given leverage. If we assume subcontracts roll over every two
      months, and the oracle expects six closing fees, this implies the oracle
      expects a 15.0% dividend on the gross RM in the AssetSwap contracts. Using the
      Gordon dividend discount model, a discount rate of 10% and a growth rate of 5%
      imply a present value of 3RM<sub>gross</sub>, where RM<sub>gross</sub> is the
      total amount of RM across all the OracleSwap AssetContracts and their LPs.</span><a name="_ftnref24"></a><a href="#_ftn24"><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref24'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:11.0pt;line-height:105%;
color:#9FB8FF'>[24]</span></span></span><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref24'></span></a><span style='mso-bookmark:_ftnref24'></p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The positions in the oracle's
      scam would probably be less than one-fourth of the outstanding positions, in
      that the contract would have to be somewhat popular to generate enough users to
      generate a valuable payoff.
      That is, if Oracle/Alice were 100% of one side, this would imply few users. This suggests
      the maximum RM aligned with the evil oracle would be at most around 0.25*RM<sub>gross</sub>.
      Given we should expect at least 50% to burn their PNL rather than continue,
      this takes the scam payoff down to 0.125*RM.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Under very modest assumptions,
      an amoral oracle would find it rational to use their oracle revenue to further
      other schemes, because even evil oracles prefer more money to less (3 &gt;
      0.125). Further, the burn option makes it likely that the evil oracle would
      receive nothing in its exit scam, and worst-case scenarios are prudent focal
      points in strategic analysis. While OracleSwap's oracle anticipates no rational
      person would burn because it anticipates updating honestly, the existence of
      this option makes the incentive compatibility of this contract more robust, as
      its mere presence is useful even if it is never enacted.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>It is important to remember the
      oracle's duties are minimal. Few duties are essential because many
      responsibilities would imply a conspicuous oracle that would be more prone to failure.
      As its job is basically to update prices daily at a set time, which can be
      scripted, the oracle's main job is to monitor its various APIs and
      data-scraping programs for changes in data formats. We do not have to consider
      the scenario of a burnt-out oracle, overwhelmed with or myriad
      responsibilities, who finds the game too tedious for reasons outside of the
      monetary cost-benefit analysis. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>As a practical matter, initially
      expected growth would be an order of magnitude greater than 5%, making the
      value of the annuity much greater than 3RM. A trusted oracle could support many
      other assets as well as atomic swaps, etc. Yet as the contract matures and
      provides a greater potential amount to steal, the proportion of non-complicit
      users&#8212;representing lost future closing fees&#8212;would increase, increasing the
      present value of its oracle fee relative to a cheat payoff. Many dapps generate
      almost zero revenue, and the only thing keeping reporters and administrators
      honest is their belief in exponential growth, which is both delusional in most
      cases, and unsustainable were it to occur. In contrast, our oracle has
      sufficient incentives in a steady-state equilibrium. OracleSwap is a long-run
      incentive compatible mechanism.</p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>The oracle contract stores
      closing prices that are accessible via a private function that only the
      OracleSwap contract can access inside the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This
      restriction prevents parasite contracts from using the oracle contract while
      not paying the oracle. While all state variable data in this contract is
      visible outside the EVM (oracle price updates generate event logs as well), the data
      recorded by the oracle contract is trivial to discover elsewhere anyway. The
      oracle problem is not technical; it is strategic; its data is only valuable in
      the context of a smart contract that is forced to use these prices. A parasite
      contract user would have to trust the parasite contract's oracle to copy this
      information truthfully outside the EVM, which is the main problem, and cost, of
      an oracle.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The contract's source code is
      available for all to copy, modify, and deploy as anyone sees fit. Simply
      copying the code is easy, the main costs are automating scripts for updating
      the oracle contract and creating a distinctive user interface. We caution new
      oracles that manually updating the data daily seems feasible initially, but
      this is not sustainable so they must automate an oracle-updating protocol
      (including an error-checking algorithm and having back-up computers online). </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>The downside to a low cost of
      entry in this space typical to all thriving markets. With anonymity and without
      a high fixed cost of entry, a hacker has little to lose by trying to abuse any
      misplaced trust in look-alike contracts. A few subtle code changes can give them a backdoor to
      contract ETH balances. Therefore, while we encourage imitators, we also advise
      users to be wary of them. Most importantly, if
      someone presents a mechanism that emphasizes zero costs, they should not be
      trusted because either they are stupid or lying, as there would be insufficient
      incentive for the oracle to be honest. </p>

    &nbsp;

    <p class=MsoNormal>Most blockchain development
      orients towards two extremes. On the one hand, you have firms emulating
      traditional institutions only they transact with crypto as well as fiat
      currency, on the other hand, you have protocols with broad generality and
      decentralized consensus or governance mechanisms like bitcoin itself. While
      these have valid use cases, they should be the exception and not the rule. The
      standard institutions invariably violate at least one of the non-negotiable
      crypto principles: transparency, immutability, anonymity, uncensorability, and
      cryptographic custody. The generalized protocol dapps have complicated
      collusion scenarios, and high consensus costs both direct (more players to pay)
      and indirect (delayed payouts). </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>OracleSwap's oracle retains its anonymity on the blockchain, making
      it immune to censorship, yet unlike merchants on the Tor network can be
      monitored and held accountable due to the transparent and immutable blockchain.
      This is what makes Ethereum so valuable, in that dapps do not need their own
      decentralized consensus mechanisms or tokens. Prices used to generate OracleSwap's
      PNLs are recorded in the oracle contract's event logs which need no parochial
      adjustment to compare to exchange prices.  </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>A set of competing OracleSwap
      contracts is more efficient than generalized oracles designed for unspecified
      contracts, or generalized trading protocols designed for unspecified oracles.
      Successful coinshifters have found that making 1% on a transaction is better
      than making 100% on a cheat because of the present value of future
      transactions. This is in a market where reputation is difficult to measure as
      there are no clear records of cross-chain transactions that can prove a cheat,
      so reputation is inferred via unverifiable anecdotes one reads in chatrooms. A
      simple contract tied to an oracle that is 'all-in' creates clear and unambiguous accountability, generating the
      strongest incentive for honest reporting.</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>Investors can create asset
      exposure that is difficult to get elsewhere while staying on the blockchain. By
      capping the weekly PNL at the required margin, investors need only attend to
      their positions once a week and maintain a long-term position. Forward starting
      prices help both the LP and investor, in that they remove any need to invest
      time and money into continuous market monitoring and low-latency access.
      Portfolio margining allows LPs to generate an attractive return while giving
      investors competitive rates, and managed accounts allow large ETH holders to
      trustlessly delegate LP duties. </p>
